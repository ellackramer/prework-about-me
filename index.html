      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am a graphic designer and professional aerial performance artist.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Marshall, Michigan.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are baking, dancing, and swimming. I currently take contortionist classes to push my flexibility to unsettling extremes.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My perfect job would be something where I could work remotely and travel the world while still maintaining a career. I also hope to tour and perform with Cirque du Soliel.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have lived in downtown Lansing for the past 6 years.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I'm fascinated by how rapidly the tech industry has expanded in the last few years, I also just genuinely enjoy the work. I found myself in the field by happenstance when I applied for a part time assistant position at a local newspaper and ended up being thrown headfirst into HTML and the basics of front end web development. </p>
